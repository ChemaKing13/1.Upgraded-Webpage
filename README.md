# Challenge1-Upgraded-Webpage

## Description

-This project helped me apply some of the knowledge seen in the first week of the bootcamp. I started this proyect because I thinkh the best way to earn new knowledge its to aplly it into something usefull. This proyect has a readable code, that makes that anybody can read it, it includes semantic HTML elements as well as CSS. Everything in this proyect works,son it is 100% debugged. 

## Credits

Its important to mention that to build this proyect I start from a given Code, my duty was only to upgrade it and make it more easy to read, but the starter code its someone else work.
